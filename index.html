      <h3 class="about_title">Why make a poll?</h3>
      <p class="about_content">
        In the India, political polls were popularized in the 20th century as a great way to predict presidential elections. Political candidates still use them today, to test the pulse of the nation and use the data to revise communication strategy and speeches to better connect with voters.
        If you're a marketer or entrepreneur, you can poll customers to get straight answers about how to improve your product or service. You can also discover which competitor, if any, has a better solution. Alternatively, you can use an NPS Survey. Using a poll creator is fast, cheap to manage, and gets you data quickly. Hand out the same poll several times throughout the year to see how crowd sentiment changes. These are called "rolling" or "tracking" polls.
        You can also create a straw poll within your organization as an online voting tool to decide which venture to pursue next. For HR, management, and similar stakeholders, polls are a great way to get a quick vote on a new vacation policy or what flavor of Doritos to get for casual Friday. They show that you’re listening. As Sir Richard Branson famously said: “Take care of your employees and they will take care of your business.”
